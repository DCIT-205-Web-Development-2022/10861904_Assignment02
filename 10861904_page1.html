        <p>
            I am <b>Kwabena Adu - Tekyi</b> by name.<br>
            I come from a family of six and I occupy the sixth position.<br> 
            My father is an accountant, while my mother is a teacher.<br>
            I am currently in level 200. I am focus driven and hardworking which reflects in my grades.<br>
            My professional aspiration is to obtain a bachelor's degree in <mark>Information Technology at the University of Ghana</mark>,
            which would promote my career goal of being a Cyber security Analyst.<br>
            The reason why I want to pursue a career in the cyber security line is to someday 
            be able to provide <i>technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices
            and data</i> from cyber attacks people in Ghana.<br>
            Hence, I study hard because without a degree I cannot attain these goals.<br>
            Aside my love for everything computer related, I love to travel and meet new people.<br>
            I am an outgoing person and I love to have fun. My live centers on improving humanity and I love where I am at right now.
        </p>
